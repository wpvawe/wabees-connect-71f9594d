# Wabees — App (Flutter) vs Website (React) Parity Audit

> Evidence-based audit. Sources scanned: `wpvawe/wabees-plus` (Flutter — 146 dart files, screens/providers/repositories/services) and this Lovable project (`docs/WEBSITE-FEATURE-INVENTORY.md` + `src/`). No guessing — every row references real files.

### E. Templates
Create / edit / delete / sync / preview / variables / buttons — screens exist. **⚠️** need to verify edit endpoint and Meta Graph fallbacks.

### F. Campaigns
Full builder/detail/analytics screens exist. Client-side executor via `campaign_execution_service`. **✅ mostly present**; verify pause-on-disconnect cascade.

### K. Settings
| Sub-feature | Web | App | Notes |

## Part 4 — Missing in APP (prioritized for implementation)

### P0 — Revenue / retention blockers (build first)
1. **Agent invite + join flow** (I) — biggest gap: owners on web invite agents, agent can't accept on phone. Adds `join_screen`, `agent_invite_repository`, deep-link handler.
2. **24-hour window enforcement in composer** (C) — sends outside window fail silently on app; users blame the product.
3. **Auto-triage listener** (H) — parity with website's owner-only AI intent/sentiment/priority tagging.
4. **Leads screen** (J) — `bot_leads` CRUD, score chips, status board.
5. **Canned responses** — editor in Settings + `/` picker in chat composer.

### P1 — Team-ops parity
6. **Availability toggle** (I) — ✅ Shipped (commit `b774359`). Chip in inbox app bar → `users/{owner}/agents/{uid}.availability`. Working-hours editor still pending.
7. **Workload screen** (J) — ✅ Shipped. `/workload` route, per-agent active-chat counts + unassigned bucket. Reachable from Settings → "Team Workload". First-response averages deferred (needs analytics rollup).
8. **SLA settings + badge** (K, C) — ✅ Shipped. `/settings/sla` writes `users/{owner}/settings/sla`; `SlaBadge` on every conversation tile; `SlaResponseStamper` writes `firstResponseAt`/`firstResponseMs` on the first outbound after an inbound (idempotent, session-cached).
9. **CSAT** (K, N) — ✅ Shipped end-to-end. `/settings/csat` writes `users/{owner}/settings/csat` (identical schema). `sendCsatSurvey`, `parseCsatReply`, `recordCsatRating`, `attachCsatComment` ported to `lib/data/services/csat_service.dart`. `CsatCaptureService` boots on owner sign-in via `csatCaptureProvider` in `MainShell`. Chat screen adds "Mark as resolved" / "Reopen" — writes `state`, appends system note via `ConversationExtrasService.setConversationState`, and auto-fires the survey when owner opted in (24 h cooldown).
10. **Bulk action bar** in inbox — ✅ Shipped (core actions). Long-press to select, tap to toggle; bar shows count + mark-read / assign-to-me / unassign. Tag/resolve/delete bulk still TODO.

### P2 — Polish & pro features
11. **Starred drawer** in inbox.
12. **OTP auto-detect** in message bubble (copyable chip).
13. **Phone health + Webhook setup cards** on connect screen.
14. **Embedded Signup (FB Login for Business)** — Flutter FB SDK.
15. **Subscription-messages admin editor**.
16. **CSV / VCF contact import** (if missing).
17. **Media lightbox** with pinch/zoom (if only basic viewer).
18. **Tag catalog UI** + colored chips on rows.

### P3 — Deferred / architectural
19. **Scheduled messages dispatcher** — should move to server cron (PHP + pg_cron equivalent or Firestore Cloud Fn); mobile app should NOT run a 30s poller. Backend work, not app.
20. **Response-time backfill** — one-time script, not app UI.
21. **Messaging Insights parity** — ✅ Shipped. Website's `/analytics` (sent/delivered/read/failed/incoming, daily bar, type pie, top contacts) is now the **Messaging** tab of the app's existing `/analytics` screen. Same shared cache (`users/{owner}/analytics_daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}`) with 5-minute today-write throttle. No duplicate screen — Billing (Meta Graph) + Messaging (Firestore rollup) live under one tabbed `/analytics`.
22. **Conversation tags parity** — ✅ Shipped. App already had backend CRUD + inbox filter chips + inline "Manage Tags" long-press dialog. Delta closed: dedicated **Settings → Tags** editor (`tag_manager_screen.dart`) with rename + recolour + delete (website `updateTag` parity), plus **chat header → Manage tags** bottom sheet with catalogue checkboxes + shortcut to the editor. Shared `users/{owner}/tags/*` collection unchanged.

---

## Part 5 — Verification still pending

File-level verification done against `wpvawe/wabees-plus` (main). Results:

- **Welcome subscription** — ✅ Present. `AuthNotifier.register()` and the Google new-user branch both call `_planRepo.assignWelcomePlan(user.uid)` right after `_userRepo.createUser(userModel)` (`lib/providers/auth/auth_notifier.dart` L248, L334).
- **Password reset** — ✅ Present (different design). App does NOT use the website's `oobCode` + `confirmPasswordReset` flow. Instead it runs a 3-step OTP flow via PHP: `POST /send-reset-code.php` → `POST /verify-reset-code.php` → falls back to `FirebaseAuth.sendPasswordResetEmail` (`lib/screens/auth/forgot_password_screen.dart`). Functionally equivalent, no gap to close.
- **CSV / VCF contact import** — ✅ Present. `lib/core/utils/contact_import_export.dart` (228 lines) — no need to build a new one. Row D "CSV import likely missing" in Part 3 is stale.
- **Template edit + delete on Meta** — ✅ Present. `TemplateRepository.editOnMeta` and `deleteOnMeta` call `WhatsAppRepository.editTemplateOnMeta` / `deleteTemplateOnMeta`, with Meta "sample template" / "already-deleted" error handling and local Firestore mirror updates (`lib/data/repositories/template_repository.dart` L92, L123).
- **Campaign pause-on-disconnect** — ❌ Missing. `lib/services/campaign_execution_service.dart` (580 lines) contains no reference to `isConnected` / `whatsappConnected` / a paused-on-disconnect cascade. If the tenant disconnects mid-campaign the client-side executor will keep trying. Should be added to P2.
- **Presence heartbeat (`user_presence_service.dart`)** — ❌ Missing. There is no such file — `lib/services/` only ships `anti_ban_service.dart`, `campaign_execution_service.dart`, `campaign_scheduler_service.dart`, `cleanup_service.dart`. The Part 1.2 mention of `user_presence_service` and the ⚠️ in Row I ("verify interval + hide/beforeunload equivalent") were both wrong — the feature is not implemented at all.
- **`chat_screen.dart` deep-dive** — done. Findings on the 3 012-line file:
  | # | Feature | Status | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Message reactions (quick-6) | ⚠️ partial | `chat_screen.dart:789–806, 959–1020` — 6 hardcoded emojis, no full emoji picker / `+` button |
  | 2 | Typing indicator | ✅ | `chat_screen.dart:82–84, 322–338` — 350 ms debounce, 20 s throttle, `sendTypingIndicator(userId, messageId: wamid)` |
  | 3 | Deleted-message rendering | ❌ | No `__DELETED__` sentinel branch, no `isDeleted` on `MessageModel` |
  | 4 | Forwarded badge | ❌ | No `forwarded` field on `MessageModel`; no "Forwarded" chip in bubble |
  | 5 | Conversation tags on header | ✅ | `chat_screen.dart:1380–1405, 1447–1448` — chip strip + "Manage tags" sheet |
  | 6 | Conversation state (open/resolved) | ✅ | `chat_screen.dart:1439–1482` — dynamic `resolve`/`reopen` menu, `_toggleResolve()` |
  | 7 | Conversation priority | ❌ | No `priority` field on `ConversationModel`; no picker |
  | 8 | Reply / quote | ✅ | `chat_screen.dart:80, 814–818, 1940–1981` + `replyTo*` sent with every send |
  | 9 | 24-h window enforcement | ⚠️ | Countdown + expired banner exist (`1289–1329, 1695–1755`) but composer is **not** hard-locked when window is closed |
  | 10 | OTP auto-detect | ❌ | No regex scan on inbound bodies, no copy-chip |
  | 11 | Starred messages | ✅ | `chat_screen.dart:868–883` + dedicated `starred_messages_screen.dart` |
  | 12 | Bulk-select in chat | ❌ | No multi-select state or bulk bar |

### Consolidated Flutter follow-ups (from Part 5 verification)

**P2 — high value, well-scoped:**
1. **Campaign pause-on-disconnect** in `campaign_execution_service.dart` — subscribe to `users/{owner}/whatsapp_config/config.isConnected` and mark in-flight campaigns `status: 'paused'` on disconnect.
2. **Agent presence service** — new `lib/services/user_presence_service.dart` writing `users/{owner}/agents/{self}.isOnline` + `lastSeenAt` on a 45 s heartbeat; `isOnline: false` on app-lifecycle-paused / logout.
3. **24-h window hard-lock** in chat composer — disable text field + attachments when `!withinWindow`, keep template picker enabled.
4. **Deleted-message placeholder** — treat inbound `body === '__DELETED__'` as an italic muted "This message was deleted" bubble.
5. **Forwarded badge** — add `forwarded: bool` on `MessageModel`, render "Forwarded" chip when true.

**P3 — polish:**
6. **Conversation priority** — add `priority: 'low'|'normal'|'high'` on `ConversationModel`, chat-header picker + inbox sort key.
7. **OTP auto-detect** — regex `\b\d{4,8}\b` on inbound bubbles, tap-to-copy chip.
8. **Full emoji picker** — add `emoji_picker_flutter` behind a `+` on the quick-6 reaction row.
9. **Bulk-select in chat** — long-press to enter multi-select, bulk bar with delete-local / forward.

### Newly promoted P2 items (from these findings)
- **Campaign pause-on-disconnect cascade** in `campaign_execution_service.dart` — listen to `users/{owner}/whatsapp_config/config.isConnected` and mark in-flight campaigns `status: 'paused'` with reason on disconnect (matches website behaviour).
- **Agent presence service** — new `lib/services/user_presence_service.dart` writing `users/{owner}/agents/{self}.isOnline` + `lastSeenAt` on a 45 s heartbeat, and `isOnline: false` on app-lifecycle-paused / logout — required for Workload / SLA parity.

---

## Part 6 — Implementation guardrails (from `mem://` + `RULES.md`)

- All writes go to same Firestore paths as web (memory: `firestore-schema`).
- Media via `https://api.wabees.live/api/upload-media.php` — never Firebase Storage.
- WhatsApp send / templates / verify only via PHP backend endpoints.
- Effective UID = `users/{uid}.dataOwner ?? uid`.
- No Firebase Admin / server code in app — client SDK only; rules enforce access.
- 3-surface deploy discipline: PHP changes → wabees-plus repo → Hostinger; Flutter changes → wabees-plus repo only (users install APK).

---

## Recommended next step

Pick a P0 slice to start (my recommendation: **#1 Agent invite/join** — smallest, highest leverage, unlocks team usage on mobile) and I ship that end-to-end (models + repo + provider + screen + router + tests) via the wabees-plus repo. Then #2, #3… in order.

---

## Part 6 — Reverse audit (Jul 2026): website features still missing in app

Verified against `wpvawe/wabees-plus@main` (178 dart files). Items previously
shipped are dropped; only real remaining gaps listed.

### Still missing (website → app)

| # | Website feature | App status | Where it should live | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Leads board** (`users/{owner}/bot_leads` — name/phone/score/status/notes CRUD) | ❌ no screen, no model, no repo | new `lib/screens/shared/leads/` + `lead_repository.dart` | **P0** |
| 2 | **Auto-triage listener** (owner-only AI intent/sentiment/priority/tags on inbound) | ❌ not wired; AI bot service exists but no triage boot in `MainShell` | new `auto_triage_service.dart` + provider booted alongside `csatCaptureProvider` | **P0** |
| 3 | **Subscription-messages admin editor** (edit templated plan-request replies) | ❌ absent in admin screens | new tab in `admin_plans_screen.dart` writing `admin/settings/subscription_messages` | **P1** |
| 4 | **Embedded Signup** (Facebook Login for Business — one-tap WA number attach) | ❌ only manual token paste flow | Flutter FB SDK on `whatsapp_connect_screen` | **P2** |
| 5 | **OTP auto-detect chip** in inbound bubbles (regex + copy) | ❌ no regex scan in `_MessageBubble` | small helper in `chat_screen.dart` bubble builder | **P2** |
| 6 | **Media lightbox gallery** — swipe between images, pinch zoom, save-to-gallery | ⚠️ single-image `InteractiveViewer` only | new `media_gallery_viewer.dart` (photo_view + PageView) | **P2** |
| 7 | **Scheduled-messages dispatcher** | architectural — belongs on **server cron**, NOT in app | PHP cron on Hostinger hitting Firestore | **P3** (backend, not app) |
| 8 | **Response-time backfill** (one-off analytics rollup) | script, not app UI | node script in wabees-plus repo | **P3** (out of app scope) |

### Already closed since original audit (for the record)

Agent invite + join (P0#1), 24-h composer lock (P0#2), Canned responses editor + `/` picker (P0#5), Availability toggle (P1#6), Workload screen (P1#7), SLA settings + badge (P1#8), CSAT end-to-end (P1#9), Bulk action bar (P1#10), Starred drawer (P2#11), Phone health card (P2#13), Tag catalog UI (P2#18), CSV/VCF import (P2#16), Conversation tags parity (P3#22), Messaging Insights parity (P3#21), Forwarded badge, Deleted-message placeholder, Campaign pause-on-disconnect, Agent presence heartbeat (45s + owner mirror).

### Recommended next slice

Ship **P0 #1 (Leads) + P0 #2 (Auto-triage)** together — both hit the same
"owner-visible pipeline off inbound messages" surface and share the Firestore
listener plumbing already used by `CsatCaptureService`. One push, two features.

Confirm priority and I'll begin.
